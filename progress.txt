Currently looks at the portfolio and gives advice only based off the stocks present in the portfolio whether to drop/buy
Further Scope:
Use adv statistical models instead of llm calls for price predictions (Stacked LSTMs, FinBERT, etc.) 
Implement a system where the app gives suggestions to invest in stocks not present in the portfolio based off news articles and the goals set by the person 
Works on a very particular csv format for now. Should be able to convert any type of portfolio into the deservrd type
